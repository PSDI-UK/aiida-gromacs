    "### Who is this tutorial for?\n",
    "This tutorial is aimed at molecular dynamics simulators who want to keep track of each step used to build and setup simulations of biomolecular systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "###Â Why not just use a script to keep a record of simulation steps?\n",
    "As simulation protocols vary between practictioners, it is often difficult to ascertain how simulations are performed to generate the dynamics of molecular systems. Generation of scripts to automate steps performed is currently the only method used to keep track of simulation steps. However, scripts do not have standardised formats and do not track what inputs are used or what outputs are produced from each command. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How can we track complex simulation protocols?\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will setup and run a coarse-grained simulation of the active state PTH2R protein via the aiida-gromacs plugin. We will show how commands are written and provenance is saved in realtime for a simulation workflow. The files inputted and outputted for each command, along with the connections between them are saved in a consistent format in an aiida database archive file (SQLite format). This output not only shows what we did, but also how we did it, making it easy to reuse and reproduce our protocol. \n"
